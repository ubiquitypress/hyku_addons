Losing a loved one is never easy, and grief is experienced differently by everyone. I lost both of my parents to cancer at a young age. When my father died, my mother stayed with him several hours after he passed. She wanted to be there with him so that he wasn't scared or alone because """"No one knows when the spirit leaves the body after death.""""</p>
<p>Three years later, my mother was hospitalized, after a year-long battle with breast cancer. My brother and I were one week into the fall school semester when we got the call. When we arrived she asked us, """"Why aren't you boys in school?"""" She was more concerned about us and our future than she was about her own health.</p>
<p>When she passed shortly after, my brother and I stayed by her side for a while as she did for our father. After her passing, we decided to return to school and finish out the fall semester.</p>
<p>That fall I took my first animation class, and I fell in love with animated storytelling. Leaming to time out every little detail gave me an appreciation for the little things in life; to cherish them because things left unspoken or unresolved lead to regret that follows us for an eternity. I wanted my capstone exhibition to incorporate these elements that had a major impact on my life: losing loved ones to illness, using animated storytelling as a form of artistic expression, and understanding that time is short and eventually runs out.</p>
<p>I Didn't Want You to Worry is an animated short film that shows what someone may go through emotionally when losing both parents with unresolved conflicts or answers. However, this piece also shares my belief that your loved ones still watch over you after they pass. Even if they can't physically reach you.</p></p><p><em>Author Biography: </em></p><p>Dr. Hartel's current research focuses on chimpanzee and human sympatry and how to balance human population growth and resource demand with chimpanzee conservation in an anthropogenic-dominated landscape. Dr. Hartel began pursing this avenue of research when she was appointed in 2013 as the Director of Conservation for the Kibale Chimpanzee Project (https://kibalechimpanzees.wordpress.com/) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Initially, she is focusing generally on assessing the major threats to chimpanzee conservation in Uganda (i.e., snaring and deforestation) while working collaboratively with other chimpanzee field projects in Uganda to develop a comprehensive picture that can better mitigate these anthropogenic threats. Dr. Hartel has also established a Chimpanzee Health, Intervention, and Monitoring Program at her field site that adopts a One Health approach to understanding and treating snare injuries and anthropozoonotic disease transmission.</p><p><em>Author Biography: </em></p><p>Holly Bokash is a portrait and landscape photographer based in Charleston, South Carolina. She received her Bachelor of Science degree in Art Marketing from the University of North Georgia in Dahlonega in 2017, concentrating in photography and graphic design. Bokash’s journey as a photographer began at a young age, always being inspired by photographs and the stories behind them. Portraiture, her main passion, allows her to connect with the subject through their personalities. Holly loves capturing moments frozen in time that tell a story and compel the viewer to experience an emotional response.</p><p><em>Author Biography: </em></p><p>Hi! I am Heather Joshi. I was born in central Florida and moved around the USA's east coast throughout my childhood. As far as my education, I earned a BFA with a drawing concentration and a BA in English at the University of Florida. I earned my MFA in Painting and Drawing at the University of Georgia. Now, I am Lecturer at the University of North Georgia's Department of Visual Arts. I have shown my work in juried shows across the country and abroad. When I am not drawing, I like to look at animals, explore the Northeast Georgia region, listen to audio books and lectures, walk in the woods and attempt to cook.</p><p><em>Title of Award Granted: </em></p><p>Presidential Innovation Incentive Award</p><p><em>Name of Institution that Granted the Award: </em></p><p>University of North Georgia</p><p><em>'Presenter Biography: </em></p><p><p><strong>Yu Ye</strong> is a Ph.D. candidate in musicology at the University of Texas at Austin.
